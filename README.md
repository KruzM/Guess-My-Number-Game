NOTE!!!

The credit to the idea of this game goes to Jonas Schmedtman from Udemy. I am currently learning programming from him, and this is one of many projects that we are going to be working on in his course. To my credit, I did mix it up to give it a personal touch, such as adding the red background if you lose, lowering total guesses to 10, and other stuff behind the scenes! 

Thank you for exploring my GitHub, and look forward to many more projects to come. I am always looking for projects, so if you have any that you would recommend, please let me know!
